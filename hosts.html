    <h2>My Top Host</h2>
    <p>The top host that I chose out of my three is <a href="http://dreamhost.com" target="_blank">Dreamhost</a>. I chose Dreamhost becuase I felt that it had the most hosting service plans and also contained a lot of availble domain plans. Most of the prices on Dreamhost were also cheaper that Bluehost and that was another reason for why I chose this as my top Hosting service.</p>
