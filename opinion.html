    <h1>Website Opinion Article</h1>

    <p>The first website that I thought was great was <a href="https://www.nike.com" target="_blank">Nike</a>. I liked this website for a variety of reasons. First being that it is built and coded very well. This website is very modern and uses color patterns of white and black to make the rest of the images on the front page of the webiste pop. It is very easy to navigate and I had no problems using it on both my computer and phone. The layout of the website is laid out in a very pleasing way and is nice to be on. I noticed that they tried to make everything very box like giving it a sharp look. When you hover over any of their navigaion tabs you get a large drop down menue that can take you to whatever you are looking for. The search bar is rounded to give it a look that is most common in most search bars. If you are navigating the website on your phone it even gives you an option to put of photo of the shoe you are looking for into the search and it will take you right to that shoe of the photo that you put in. They also use a large variety of images in the website so that you can see what you are looking for. Overall I give this webiste a 10 out of 10.</p>
    <p>The next website that I also liked was <a href="https://www.espn.com" target="_blank">ESPN</a>. Similar to Nike, this website is also built well and has a large varitey of information and places to find information. This website uses a large varity of colors that draw the viewers attention in different places. Most of the borders and tabs that you can click in this website have rounded corners, which I think gives it a nice clean look. They also use a large variety of pictures that act as thumbnails to links about different articals containg information on this website is very modern and you can tell that it is updated very frequently. Overall I give this website an 8 out of 10. </p>
    <p>One website that I found that I did not like very much was <a href="https://torontocupcake.com" target="_blank">torontocupcake</a>. This is a website that I found as I was doing some cupcake shopping. I was looking for a place to find some quality cupcakes in Toronto and chose this website. This was a mistake because this website is very boring and does not contain a lot of information. It has a very bad navigation page and is not appealing to the eye. the main colors that it uses are white and pink which is ok because there are a lot of cupcakes that have white and pink frosting. There is no tab that I can click on this website to buy a cupcake and there is not even a search bar. The website contains about two pictures and some plain black text. I did not like this website and thought it was very boring. Overall I give this about a 2 out of 10. </p>
