            <h1>Fly Fishing is Fun!</h1>
            <p>
                Many people have different hobbies and different ways to relax and have fun. One hobby that contains both of these aspects is fly fishing. Fly fishing is different from regular fishing. Fly fishing uses the weight of the line to carry the fly or bait to the specific spot that you are trying to cast. Regular fishing uses the lure at the end of the line to gain casting distance to the spot you are trying to reach. Fly fishing is mainly done on a river compared to a lake or pond. When fly fishing you need to know what kinds of fish you are attempting to catch so you can imitate their food source with the right color, size and shape of fly. You also need to know where the fish are hanging out on the river so you can target the right spots. And, since you are standing in the river, you also need a few pieces of basic gear so that you can be successful.
