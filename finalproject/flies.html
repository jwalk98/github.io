            <h1>What are some different types of flies?</h1>
            <p>
                There are a large variety of flies that can be used. The factors that go into choosing the right one are the time of year, time of day, and the spot on the river that you are fishing. The fly that is shown in the first picture is a dry fly. Dry flies are flies that float on top of the water and imitate a bug that is floating on top of the water such as a grasshopper would do. The kind of fly that is shown in the second picture is called a streamer. Streamers are flies that sink beneath the water to imitate a small fish or even a large underwater bug. The kind of fly that is shown in the last picture is called a nymph. Nymphs are flies that also sink beneath the water and hug the bottom of the river to imitate smalls bugs that are living underneath rocks or between rocks.
