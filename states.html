    <h1>List of States In Order From Best to Worst</h1>
    <h2><a href="https://www.alabama.gov" target="_blank">1. Alabama</a></h2>
    <p>I chose Alabama for my favorite website for several reasons. Right off the start I really liked the colors that they used for the website, I think that the blue and the white go really well togeather and have a calming effect when you are viewing the website. All the information on the website is easy to access and is spread out in a nice fashion. The menu is easy to navigate and have a huge search bar right in the middle is the site, leaving access to search whatever you are looking for. The website also works on mobile screens as well as larger screens. All the links on the website load quickly and get you where you need to go fast.

    <h2><a href="https://www.mass.gov" target="_blank">2. Massachusetts</a></h2>
    <p>For my second state I chose Massachusetts. I chose Massachusetts as my second favorite state becuase I also liked the colors that they used for the website. Like Alabama they chose a white and blue sceme with a yellow color to highlight alerts or things of importance on the front page. The website has a good menu with popular topics at the top of the page and links to those topics that load fast. They also have a handy seach bar in the middle of the website that allows me to seach whatever I am looking for. The reason why I put this in second place is because they do not have very good mobile screen access. When you go to mobile the links at the top of the menu completely dissapear, the search bar is still avalible, but the main links that you can use to get around dissapear. </p>

    <h2><a href="https://mn.gov/portal/" target="_blank">3. Minnesota</a></h2>
    <p>The state that is taking third place in my ranking is Minnesota. Minnesota had an okay looking website, but the leaf background that they chose was not super appealing to me. They have an okay menu at the top of the page, one problem that I noticed with it was that they some of the menu items have a super small drop down menu with links that are put into a very small words. Only a few of the menu words have drop down menus, so they are missing things that others may have. This website is also not very functional in mobile form as the whole menu dissapears as you go into mobile view. The website did not have any loading problem that I could tell and also had a convient search bar in the middle of the page which seemed to be the main focus on the website. Overall had to put this at my third becuase of the color sceme as well as the lack of design on the menu bar. </p>
    <h2><a href="https://www.nh.gov/index.htm" target="_blank">4. New Hampshire</a></h2>

    <p>The website that I chose for second to last is New Hampshire. I chose New Hampshire because I did not like how the website looked from the start. I thought that it was not very sharp overall and had a very outdated look to it. There was a lot of "old" pictures on the website that did not really match the color sceme on the website. The menu bar was small as well as the search bar in the middle of the page. This website was also not build for mobile phones because when you shrink it down you have to scroll over to be able to see the whole page, which can cause people to become angry because it is hard to navigate. Overall the website looked old and that it needs to be updated or re done. </p>
    <h2><a href="https://alaska.gov" target="_blank">5. Alaska</a></h2>
    <p>The website that I chose for my least favorite is Alaska. I chose this as my least favorite because it shared a lot of charactaristics as the New Hampshire website except worse. The website looked super out dated and not appealing at all. The drop down menu from the main menu words are very cluttered making it harder to find information than it should. This website also has a very small search bar at the top right of the page which is interesting becuase I feel that a search bar is an important part of a state website. This website is also not very mobile compatable becuase when you shrink it down the website does not shrink with you making it very hard to navigate it when you are on your phone. Overall needs to get re done and take some points from the Alabama website. </p>
